abstract: Equity hedge Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS) funds pursue hedge fund-like active management strategies subject to high liquidity and transparency constraints, which are ensured by regulatory oversight. Understanding the performance of these alternative funds is of utmost importance in fund selection and optimizing the portfolio allocation. When the fund-of-fund allocation is momentum based, there is economic value in using factor models to disentangle the fund-specific residual perfor- mance (alpha) from the return component that can be explained by the fund's exposure to common style and asset-based factors (beta). We obtain this result through a detailed analysis of the equity hedge UCITS funds' net returns using both the peer return style-factor and asset-based risk factor models over the period 2010â€“2016. The performance of a monthly rebalanced momentum-based fund-of-fund allocation is improved when ranking funds using the residual performance after correcting for false discoveries, as compared to the traditional use of rolling averages of past returns.
